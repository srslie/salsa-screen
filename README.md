# Salsa Screen

Enjoying cinema can be like dipping the chip of your conciousness into a bowl of entertainment salsa: some are excitingly spicy, others disappointingly mild.

But you never know if you'll like it until you try it—

—until now.

At [Salsa Screen](LINK HERE), experts have rated the hotness of your movies to display a salsa-rating that can steer you towards the savory experiences you desire and deserve.

Users can:

- See a display of movies
- Click a movie to view only that movie and its details
- Be able to return to the home view of all movies
- Navigate through the site using back or forward arrows

This is the first project of Turing School Mod 3.
## Goals

In this project, my goal was to gain familiarity with using React and React Router, as this was my initial experience with these technologies.

It was also a great chance to continue practicing my CSS, which is where I've felt slowest and least comfortable. I wanted to spend extra time practicing skills I'm not confident in, which might normally be designated to a collaborator if this was a paired project.

Our cohort had an uneven number of students, and instead of joining a pair to complete this project, I challenged myself to do it solo. That way, I had more experience with all aspects of the code and held myself accountable in a self-organized project, with git workflow, timeline requirements, and assessment of realistic goals.

There were struggles being inexperienced and not having a partner to bounce ideas off of, but I was sure to use my mentor and reach out for second opinions to avoid pitfalls of my own limited perspective. Plus, I had less merge conflicts or meeting obligations that allowed me more time to work on my ideas, despite not having someone to split the work with, so I'm happy I pushed to do this project independently.

I'm proud of what I was able to learn and achieve, and grateful for the opportunity to see areas where I can spend more time working to do better in the future.
## Technologies

This project was utlized:

- **ES6 Javascript** with a focus on DRY, SRP, OOP code
- **React** & **React Router** bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- **Cypress** end-to-end testing
- **SCSS** broken out into logical stylesheets using mixins and nesting
- A **CSS [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)** file for browser compatability
- **Accessibility testing** using [aria labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label) and [Colorblinding](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblinding/dgbgleaofjainknadoffbjkclicbbgaa?hl=en) checks alongside **semantic HTML**
- **Webpack** bundling 
- **Github pages** deployment
- **Git workflow**, PR template, a kanban project board, wireframing, and self-management of design and development modeled after Agile
- UPDATE WITH STRETCH TECHNOLOGIES (Express, etc)
## Contributors

This app was coded by me, [Alice Ruppert](https://www.srslie.com/), following a [spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) by Turing School staff.

Special thanks to my mentor, [Scott Schipke](https://github.com/sschipke) for his technical support, and my partner for all the food and insistence on life details like water and sleep.

## Future Iterations

In 14 days, I gained skills and familiarity through this first React project, but there are ample areas where time constraints tempered my ambitions.

While no further iterations are planned, future improvements might include:
- More refactoring!
- ADD HERE MEHEARTY!

DELETE THIS AFTER DEPLOYED!
## Instructons for Me

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
